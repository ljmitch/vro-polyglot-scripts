# vro-polyglot-scripts
A collection of vRealize Orchestrator Polyglot scripts to bootstrap your multi language vRO development

## About this Repository
This repository provides simple template-like scripts to get you up to speed with the multi language development in vRO 8.1. The functions provide a good starting point upon which you can extend.

You if have been developing vRO workflows you will notice that the new format and structure is different that the classical vRO JavaScript, but if you are familiar with AWS Lambda, Azure Functions and vRA ABX you will understand why as it closely follows  the format of those function execution engines.
